## Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) for Wave Apps

Wave ML (`h2o-wave-ml`) is a companion package for H2O Wave that makes it quick and easy to integrate AI/ML models into your applications.

Wave ML provides a simple, high-level API for training, deploying, scoring and explaining machine learning models, letting you build predictive and decision-support applications entirely in Python.

Wave ML runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows, and utilizes [H2O.ai's](https://h2o.ai) open-source [H2O](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3) and [AutoML](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) under the hood.

When Wave apps are run in [H2O AI Hybrid Cloud](https://www.h2o.ai/hybrid-cloud/) with GPU support, Wave ML optionally switches over to [Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/) for automatic feature engineering, machine learning, model deployment, and monitoring.
